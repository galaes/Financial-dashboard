### Objective

This project showcases a financial analysis dashboard built using Excel, Google Sheets, and Power BI. The dashboard supports decision-making by visualizing key financial metrics like sales, profit, and profit margin, using three widely used platforms to demonstrate tool versatility.

### Dataset

The dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/buny12345/financial-sample-power-bi-dashboard) contains the following key features:

- Date-based sales transactions spanning multiple months
- Geographical data: Country and Segment
- Product-level breakdowns: Product name, units sold, sale price, discount bands
- Financial metrics: Gross Sales, Discounts, Net Sales, Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), and Profit
- A calculated Profit Margin column was created for additional analysis

## Tools

- Excel: Used for pivot tables, slicers, KPI cards, conditional formatting, and overall dashboard layout
- Google Sheets: Recreated the Excel dashboard with dropdown filters and dynamic formulas (e.g., FILTER, SUMIF)
- Power BI: Built an interactive BI version using DAX for KPI logic, slicers for user-driven filtering, and conditional formatting for data highlights
